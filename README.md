## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me reinforce the importance of semantic HTML. I practiced using elements like main, ul, ol, and <strong> to structure content clearly and meaningfully. I also styled the layout using custom CSS, focusing on visual hierarchy and spacing.

Although I didnâ€™t use elements like section, table, or hr, I found creative ways to achieve the same visual results using styled <div>s. I'm still learning how to make layouts fully responsive, and this project gave me a good opportunity to experiment with media queries and mobile-first design.

```html
<hr class="divisoria">
```
```css
.divisoria {
    border: none;
    height: 1px;
    background-color: #ccc;
    margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
    width: 95%;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to focus on honing my responsive design skills to ensure my layouts adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. I also want to deepen my understanding of CSS variables to help me organize styles efficiently and make the project easier to maintain.
