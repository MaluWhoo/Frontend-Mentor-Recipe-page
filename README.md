## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me reinforce the importance of semantic HTML. I practiced using elements like <main>, <ul>, <ol>, and <strong> to structure content clearly and meaningfully. I also styled the layout using custom CSS, focusing on visual hierarchy and spacing.

Although I didnâ€™t use elements like <section>, <table>, or <hr>, I found creative ways to achieve the same visual results using styled <div>s. I'm still learning how to make layouts fully responsive, and this project gave me a good opportunity to experiment with media queries and mobile-first design.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<hr class="divisoria">
```
```css
.divisoria {
    border: none;
    height: 1px;
    background-color: #ccc;
    margin: 0.5rem 1rem;
    width: 95%;
}
```

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
